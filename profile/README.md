## What is data journalism?
Data journalism is an emerging subfield of journalism, and often combines data, visual, and narrative reporting into digital stories. Examples include isometric illustrations, statistical explorations, and interactive essays. Think Propublica Data, New York Times Interactive, or The Pudding.
